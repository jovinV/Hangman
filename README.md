## Making it work üõ†Ô∏è
Programed with Typescript, HTML and CSS in React + Vite. I mostly did this project to practice using Typescript and React, learn how to deploy a site along with Vite, and practice implementing responsive design, but I ended up also really getting into the visuals and animations.

## Making it look ‚ú®<em>pretty</em>‚ú®
After completing the functionality, I kept playing around with the CSS, going with a minimal black and white theme inspired by the Notion logo. I was able to make a fun 3D-like button press effect by adding multiple box shadows to each key, giving the illustion of a cubical button popping out of the screen. I learned a lot about CSS transitions and keyframes, resulting in some hoving and pressing animations that I find very satisfying.
