# Hangman.

<strong>Hangman.</strong> is a web-based hangman game based on tutorial from Web Dev Simplified https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ONUyenGnWw

## Making it work üõ†Ô∏è
Made with Typescript, HTML and CSS in React + Vite. This project's purpose was mostly to practice using Typescript and React, learn how to deploy a site along with Vite, and understand how to implement responsive design, but I ended up really getting into the visuals and animations of the game.

## Making it look ‚ú®<em>pretty</em>‚ú®
After finishing the game I kept playing around with CSS and trying to make it look nice. I was able find a cool 3D button effect by adding multiple box shadows to each key. I learned a lot about CSS transitions and keyframes, resulting in some animations that I really enjoyed making. I find hovering over the keys very satisfying.
